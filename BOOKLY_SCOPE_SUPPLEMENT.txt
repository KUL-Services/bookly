Bookly Scope Expansion Addendum

Overview
The following addendum captures the additional product scope that was introduced after the original MVP proposal. These items focus on multi-branch intelligence and an advanced scheduling suite that goes beyond the baseline marketplace, booking, and admin experiences.

Added Deliverables
1. Advanced Multi-Mode Calendar Suite
   • Dual scheduling engines (appointment-based staff calendars and static class schedules) with a single UI.
   • Capacity-aware bookings, FullCalendar bridge, and quick-action overlays for new appointments, time reservations, and time off.
   • Custom multi-staff and multi-room day/week grids that respect branch filters and provide instant navigation controls.

2. Branch-Centric Filtering & Data Governance
   • Persistent branch/staff/room filters shared across the dashboard so every decision is location-aware.
   • Branch-aware pipelines for all events, capacity checks, and utilization metrics, ensuring each location operates independently while sharing the same platform.

3. Staff Shifts, Breaks, Time-Off & Reservations
   • Shifts timeline, duplicate/copy tooling, and a detailed shift editor with break management.
   • Hourly and all-day time-off requests with approvals, recurrence, and reservations that translate into calendar overlays.
   • Unified staff drawers connecting service assignments, working hours, and calendar visibility per branch.

4. Resource (Room) Management for Static Scheduling
   • CRUD management for rooms/amenities per branch, including capacity and color-coding.
   • Static slot templates linked to rooms so capacity enforcement, overrides, and conflict detection stay per location.

5. Commission & Financial Oversight Enhancements
   • Nested commission configuration by service/product categories or individual staffers, with onboarding popovers and flexible scopes (provider vs seller).
   • Hooks for expanded payout tracking and promo management inside the admin workspace.

Cost Impact
• Original MVP quote (including super admin): 210,000 EGP
• Added scope effort: +65% (advanced calendar, branch handling, shifts, resources, commissions)
• Revised project total: 350,000 EGP

Notes
The revised total includes integration, responsive QA, and documentation for the new modules. Hosting, gateway fees, and post-launch retainers remain unchanged from the MVP proposal.
