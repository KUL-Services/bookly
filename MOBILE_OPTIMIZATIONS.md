## üá™üá¨ Egypt Regional Deployment

### Country Configuration

1. **Country Code**
   - Added `+20` for Egypt to `COUNTRY_CODES`
   - Set as default country code in initial form data
   - Appears first in dropdown

2. **Timezone**
   - Added `Africa/Cairo` to `TIMEZONES`
   - Set as default timezone for all new registrations

3. **Postal Code Validation**
   - Egyptian postal code pattern: 5 digits (`/^\d{5}$/`)
   - Added to validation utils

4. **Location Data**
   - Egypt added to countries list
   - Set as default country (EG)
   - Appears first in dropdown for regional deployment

### OTP Verification - Hidden

For the Egypt market, the OTP verification step has been **commented out** to streamline the registration process:

- Step removed from stepper UI
- Navigation skips from Account ‚Üí Business Basics
- Phone/OTP fields still stored in form data (for future use)
- Easily re-enabled by uncommenting in [index.tsx](./src/views/RegisterWizard/index.tsx)

**Why hidden?**
- Faster registration process for Egyptian businesses
- Reduces friction during onboarding
- Can be re-enabled when SMS/OTP infrastructure is ready
